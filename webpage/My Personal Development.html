<center><h1><i><u>My Strengths</u></i></h1><br></br></center>
<center><h3><i>My Communication Skills</i></h3> </center>
<p> In the early years of my life, I struggled with shyness and social anxiety.
When I started high school, I understood how crucial it was to collaborate, ask questions, 
and provide feedback, especially for group projects.Over the years, I have really improved 
my communication abilities, even as I entered the workplace and interacted with people 
I had never met before. However, communication is necessary to foster teamwork and increase efficiency.

<center><h3><i>My Determination</i></h3> </center>
<p>Even when the task seems difficult or becomes demanding, my drive will not allow me to 
stop until it has been completed. This has been one of my strongest traits for the longest time. 
My ability to overcome challenges and barriers that stand between me and my goals has significantly
improved over the past several years, and I can now clearly see where this strength has helped me.

<center><h3><i>My Creativity</i></h3></center>
<p>I can recall being in touch with my creative side since I was 10 years old, whether it be through
 music or arts and crafts. At the age of 15, my artistic talent led me to find the art of painting 
and drawing; here is where I acquired the skill without receiving formal instruction.
With that one innovative idea, I began drawing more within a short period of time, and 
even now, it is regarded as one of my most valuable assets.

<center><h3><i>“Twelve Pillars” by Jim Rohn and Chris Widener.</i></h3></center>
<p>In this tale, Michael Jones, whose car broke down on the side of the road, walks to the nearest house 
without a phone and discovers the "Twelve Pillars," a plantation-style estate. The maintenance worker, Charlie, 
assists Michael in getting back on the road and along the process develops a 
friendship with him and shares with him– the Twelve Pillars of Success –

<p>This book taught me that the main benefit of creating goals is how motivated they make you to achieve them. 
It also taught me that when you write down your objectives, they suddenly become real rather than simply ideas in your head.
Everyday has many opportunities, but only one best opportunity, as stated in chapter 5 of the book. This quote suggests 
that we should design our own lives and not just get by day to day, but rather seize the moment and make use of the
best opportunity because, as the book stated, "discipline weighs ounces and regret weighs tons." Therefore, why 
sit back and watch an opportunity pass you by and then you regret it later when you could go for it first-hand.
In Chapter 5, I was introduced to the idea that I will not develop if I associate with people who are easygoing; rather, 
I should seek out people who have high standards for behavior. Because ultimately, the people you associate with have a big impact on your mindset.
Finally, I discovered in chapter 7 that education is the foundation of prosperity. Since information is the key to success, 
it is crucial to keep learning new things every day even after you have completed your formal schooling.center
